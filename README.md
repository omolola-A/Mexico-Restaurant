## Introduction

In today's competitive restaurant industry, investors and entrepreneurs must have a firm grasp of customer behavior and market dynamics to succeed. This analysis looks into a dataset called the restaurant rating dataset which contains information about restaurants in Mexico. A customer survey was carried out in this city in 2012 to collate information about each restaurant, their cuisines, information about their consumers, and the preferences of the consumers. Variables like demand-supply dynamics and customer demographics give an insightful analysis of the restaurant rating dataset. By analyzing the characteristics of well-known restaurants, gauging consumer preferences, and identifying potential gaps in the market, we want to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making in a dynamic business.

## Data Source

The restaurant rating dataset, which comes from Digitaley Drive's extensive training program, presents a unique opportunity to apply recently learned data analysis techniques in a real-world setting. The data, which was collected through a consumer survey in 2012, gives a comprehensive overview of Mexico City's diverse dining scene.
With comprehensive details on restaurant variables including cuisine types, location specifications, and client demographics, this dataset offers an amazing mosaic of insights that are just waiting to be investigated. To gather useful information that assists investors and business owners in making strategic decisions, analysts can spot potential market opportunities, spot trends in consumer behavior, and look into the elements that affect restaurant ratings.

## Problem Statement

With so many factors influencing customer behavior and market dynamics, investors and entrepreneurs in the dynamic restaurant industry need to make informed decisions. The main objective is to identify significant insights that drive strategic choices and encourage industry expansion using the restaurant rating dataset.

Specifically, the analysis aims to address the following questions:

1. What are the factors contributing to the success of the highest-rated restaurants? How do consumer preferences influence restaurant ratings?
2. What are the prevailing consumer demographics in Mexico City's dining scene, and do they indicate any biases within the dataset?
3. Are there untapped market opportunities or demand-supply gaps that can be leveraged to drive business growth?

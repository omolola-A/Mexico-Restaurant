![](https://github.com/omolola-A/Mexico-Restaurant/blob/main/mexican-restaurant.webp)

## Introduction

In today's competitive restaurant industry, investors and entrepreneurs must have a firm grasp of customer behavior and market dynamics to succeed. This analysis looks into a dataset called the restaurant rating dataset which contains information about restaurants in Mexico. A customer survey was carried out in this city in 2012 to collate information about each restaurant, their cuisines, information about their consumers, and the preferences of the consumers. Variables like demand-supply dynamics and customer demographics give an insightful analysis of the restaurant rating dataset. By analyzing the characteristics of well-known restaurants, gauging consumer preferences, and identifying potential gaps in the market, we want to provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making in a dynamic business.

## Data Source

The restaurant rating dataset, which comes from Digitaley Drive's extensive training program, presents a unique opportunity to apply recently learned data analysis techniques in a real-world setting. The data, which was collected through a consumer survey in 2012, gives a comprehensive overview of Mexico City's diverse dining scene.
With comprehensive details on restaurant variables including cuisine types, location specifications, and client demographics, this dataset offers an amazing mosaic of insights that are just waiting to be investigated. To gather useful information that assists investors and business owners in making strategic decisions, analysts can spot potential market opportunities, spot trends in consumer behavior, and look into the elements that affect restaurant ratings.

## Problem Statement

With so many factors influencing customer behavior and market dynamics, investors and entrepreneurs in the dynamic restaurant industry need to make informed decisions. The main objective is to identify significant insights that drive strategic choices and encourage industry expansion using the restaurant rating dataset.

Specifically, the analysis aims to address the following questions:

1. What are the factors contributing to the success of the highest-rated restaurants? How do consumer preferences influence restaurant ratings?
2. What are the prevailing consumer demographics in Mexico City's dining scene, and do they indicate any biases within the dataset?
3. Are there untapped market opportunities or demand-supply gaps that can be leveraged to drive business growth?
   
## Method of Analysis

To generate insightful findings and encourage data-driven decision-making, the restaurant rating data was carefully analyzed with Power BI as the primary analytical tool. The following steps were part of the analysis technique, which followed a methodical approach:

1. Data Preparation: To ensure consistency and integrity of the data, the restaurant rating dataset was loaded into Power BI initially. For reliable analysis, this needed filling in any 
   gaps in the data, eliminating abnormalities, and arranging different kinds of information.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Power BI allowed major elements in the dataset to be analyzed through interactive visualizations and easily navigable dashboards. An overview of the 
   dataset's characteristics were first given via descriptive statistics, which included the distribution of restaurant reviews and the breakdown of client demographics.

3. Partitioning and Filtering: The dataset was partitioned based on several characteristics, such as the type of cuisine, the location, and the client demographics, by utilizing Power 
   BI's dynamic filtering tools. By picking particular data subsets for further study, this segmentation made it possible to conduct a more thorough investigation. 

4. Statistical Analysis: By using statistical techniques like hypothesis testing and correlation analysis, which were made feasible by Power BI's analytical capabilities, significant 
   patterns in the data were found and links between variables were created.

5. Visualization and Dashboard Creation: The rich visualization capabilities of Power BI made it possible to create captivating dashboards and visuals that effectively communicated the 
   key conclusions of the analysis. Bar charts, line graphs, and maps were a few of the images used to clearly and succinctly convey the findings.

6. Iterative analysis and refinement: The data from the preliminary investigations served as a guide for the analysis and enhancement of the results, which were carried out repeatedly. 
   Owing to continuous improvement and refinement, the analysis stayed concentrated on achieving the core goals and deriving insightful conclusions from the data.

   ## Modelling

To enhance data exploration, identify underlying trends, and generate predictive insights for the Power BI analysis of the restaurant rating dataset, a modeling technique was applied. The dataset contains five tables, and necessary relationships were generated. Through the use of modeling techniques in Power BI, predictive insights that improved data-driven decision-making in the restaurant industry were generated, giving stakeholders the knowledge they needed to lead strategic initiatives and meet organizational goals.

## Findings

- It was observed that Emilianos, Michilco Restaurant Jap, Restaurant Las Mananitas, Cafe Punta Del Cielo, and Giovannis among others are highly rated restaurants according to the 
  statistics. It is evident from the analysis that several factors contribute to the high ratings of the top-performing restaurants. To begin with, there is a strong correlation between 
  positive ratings for both food and service and overall restaurant ratings. Consumers tend to give restaurants with excellent food and service better overall ratings. This highlights 
  the importance of prioritizing food quality and service excellence to satisfy patrons and improve ratings in general. Findings also show most well-regarded restaurants have menus in 
  the middle of the price range providing more evidence that there may be a sweet spot in pricing strategy that resonates strongly with patrons. While excessively high prices may drive 
  away patrons, low-cost restaurants may struggle to retain their perceived value and quality.
- Moreover, the popularity of Mexican food in highly regarded restaurants suggests that customers may have a preference for this particular cuisine. Although every restaurant might 
  provide a different kind of food, Mexican food is so popular that ratings might be improved by catering to customer tastes. This emphasizes how crucial it is to accommodate customer 
  preferences and tastes to increase overall satisfaction and ratings. The relationship between ratings and restaurant location also indicates how customer demographics affect ratings. 
  While restaurants in less densely populated locations could find it difficult to draw customers and earn high ratings, those in places with higher consumer populations typically 
  receive higher ratings. This shows that favorable evaluations and general success in the restaurant industry largely depend on recognizing and meeting the demands and 
  preferences of the local customer base.
- The analysis of consumer demographics within the surveyed population reveals several notable trends. Singles comprise the overwhelming majority, accounting for approximately 92.75% 
  of the surveyed consumers, while married individuals represent only 7.25%. Moreover, students dominate the occupation demographic, constituting approximately 81.88% of the surveyed 
  population, with employed and unemployed individuals making up 11.59% and 6.52%, respectively. In terms of age groups, younger demographics are prominently represented, with 
  individuals aged 8-24 constituting approximately 72.46% of the surveyed population. Those aged 25-30 make up around 17.39%, while older age groups (31-45) and (60-82) represent 2.9% 
  and 7.25%, respectively.
- The consumer demographics point to a substantial bias in the sample in favor of younger, single people and students. Perceptions of consumer preferences and behaviors may be skewed by 
  the overrepresentation of these demographic groups, especially if the dataset does not sufficiently capture a variety of demographic profiles. For instance, the prevalence of singles 
  and students may have an impact on the kinds of eateries and cuisines that are represented in the dataset, which could have an effect on the analysis as a whole and the conclusions 
  that are made. Consequently, even though the consumer demographics that have been observed offer insightful information about the population that was questioned, it is important to 
  interpret these results cautiously and take into account any potential biases that might be present in the data sample.
- The analysis of the restaurant rating dataset uncovers demand & supply gaps that can be exploited within the market in the following areas:
  a. Price Segmentation: Given that the majority of restaurants with high ratings charge medium prices and those with low ratings charge low prices, there may be room for price 
     segmentation. By providing mid-range options with exceptional food quality and service, entrepreneurs may want to target customers who are searching for high-quality dining 
     experiences at reasonable costs.

  b. Customer demographics: Restaurant products can be customized to better suit the tastes and habits of the surveyed population, which is dominated by singles, students, and younger 
     age groups. For instance, businesses should use menu items and marketing tactics created especially to cater to the tastes and financial constraints of young professionals and 
     students.

  c. Facilities and Services: Potential areas for differentiation and competitive advantage are highlighted by the research of facilities like parking and smoking rules. Entrepreneurs 
     looking to attract health-conscious customers and improve overall eating experiences could think about introducing smoke-free rules or providing convenient parking alternatives.

- After analyzing a variety of factors related to the restaurant industry, many important characteristics stand out as important factors to take into account when making a potential 
  investment:
  
  a. Food and Service Quality: Since these factors have a significant impact on customer happiness and overall ratings, it is imperative to invest in a restaurant that prioritizes these 
     areas.

  b. Price plan: Restaurants with moderate prices tend to receive higher reviews, indicating that their pricing plan achieves a balance between affordability and perceived value. 
     Consequently, it makes financial sense to invest in a restaurant that adheres to market trends and has competitive pricing.

  c. Cuisine Diversity: Although serving a particular niche market may bring in business, opening a restaurant with a broad menu that features popular choices like Mexican food would 
     attract a bigger customer base and lessen the risk of patrons' tastes changing.

  d. Location and Customer Demographics: Investing in a restaurant located in a densely populated area, such as a metropolitan hub, may increase foot traffic and ratings. Additionally, 
     as they align with current consumer trends, targeting demographics like singles, students, and younger age groups may help you succeed.

  e. Franchise Opportunities: Franchised restaurants will be taken into account because they receive higher ratings and the benefits of established brand awareness and operational 
     support. 

  f. Services and Amenities: Purchasing a restaurant with useful features like parking areas and smoke-free areas can enhance the eating experience overall and attract a wider customer 
     base. Additionally, being conveniently located for public transportation attracts more consumers.

- To sum up, investing in a restaurant that prioritizes high-quality food and service, competitive pricing, a wide range of menu options, a prime location, and practical amenities is in 
  line with industry trends and preferences. Furthermore, investors should position themselves for success in this competitive and dynamic industry by taking advantage of franchise 
  opportunities and remaining aware of market dynamics.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

Overall, examining the dataset of restaurant ratings offers insightful new information on the competitive and ever-changing restaurant business. Following a comprehensive analysis of numerous aspects, such as the caliber of the food and services, the price structure, the menu options, customer profiles, franchising possibilities, and the facilities, several noteworthy findings have been made.

Reputable eateries typically offer good food and service at affordable pricing, with a focus on popular cuisines like Mexican. Moreover, the demographic profile they prefer sketching is characterized by younger age groups, singles, and students. Their success is also influenced by the presence of franchised businesses and the accessibility of helpful amenities. Conversely, most underappreciated restaurants have lower prices, probably a more limited selection of dishes, and perhaps even less alluring features. They also have trouble satisfying customer requests and attracting a diverse audience.

All things considered, the report highlights how important it is to identify tactical opportunities for growth and differentiation in the restaurant industry, as well as to understand consumer preferences and capitalize on market trends. Through the application of these data, entrepreneurs and investors may make informed decisions that support their business endeavors, navigate the competitive environment, and offer customers exceptional dining experiences.

### Recommendations

Using the restaurant rating dataset as a guide, the following recommendations are made for investors and company owners who want to enhance operations in the restaurant industry and capitalize on market opportunities:

- Increase Menu Selections: Increase the number of meals offered on the menu beyond the well-known Mexican fare to better suit patrons' shifting preferences. To attract more customers, 
  try some inventive recipe development and research the newest trends in food trends.

- Objective Price Segments: Implement a well-considered pricing strategy that targets various market segments. Provide mid-range options with exceptional food and service if you want to 
  draw in clients who are searching for fine dining experiences at affordable prices.

- Catering to Customer Demographics: Take into account the preferences and spending patterns of the most common consumer demographics, such as younger age groups, singles, and students, 
  while designing restaurant offers, menu selections, and marketing strategies. To attract and retain these customers, use customized incentives and loyalty schemes.

- Investigate Franchise Opportunities: Partnering with well-known franchise organizations allows you to benefit from their operational support, consumer trust, and brand visibility. 
  Look into franchising opportunities with reputable businesses to obtain a competitive advantage and satisfy present market demand.

- Invest in places like parking spaces, smoke-free locations, and conveniently located transit to make amenities and services better. It is possible to attract and enhance smoke-free 
  policies and dining experiences by promoting health-conscious dining options and making parking simple.

- Employ Technology: Adopt technological solutions such as digital marketing, smartphone apps, and online ordering platforms to enhance customer interaction, speed up procedures, and 
  increase income. Use data analytics tools to gather insights into the preferences and behaviors of your target audience so that you may develop customized experiences and marketing 
  campaigns.

- Place Quality and Reliability First: Excellent food, reliable service, and quality in all aspects of the eating experience should be given attention. To ensure a consistent supply of 
  high-quality products use strict quality control measures, personnel training programs, and customer feedback systems.

By putting these strategies into effect, investors and entrepreneurs may position their restaurants for success, stand out in a crowded industry, and encourage business growth and profitability.
